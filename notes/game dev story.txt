Game Dev Story :

The first idea for a game concept was a system of floating entities.
Entities was following a bigger entity with a concept, a moral symbol or a social subject.
I've remembered about a class by Alain Lioret about the IA behavior called boids or flocking,
and I really wanted to develop further this algorithm.

Later, the Ludum Dare #33 was starting soon, the warmup weekend was open.

I decided to code early on the boids engine, so I could have time to make more illustrations.
I finally made a boids prototype that could display a message and had collisions
(try prototype : http://leon196.github.io/Boids/)

Then ! The game jam start and I'm starting to have a new idea :
Like in horizontal scroller, you control the character's thoughts, and have to avoid rectangular signs.
The game would take place in a subway for example,
and the signs would be oppressive ads like the movie They Live ('obey', 'buy', ...)
But I was in vacation at the country-side,
and I already work all the week at the office, coding iPhone apps and Oculus 360 players.
(where I work : http://www.dvmobile.fr/)

So after failing at rewriting a rectangular collision system (something already done in the past!)
I focused on the actual game mechanic and was inspired by Osmos (http://www.osmos-game.com/)
Big bubbles can absorb little ones. Absorbing make the bubble grow and split when too large.

I've quickly saw that the rhythm and the speed of the boids did not fit with a relaxed puzzle game.
And there was no real balance of anything so the bubbles multipy themself indefinilety

I accepted to not finish it, because the real thing was the Oujevipo Contest #2.
