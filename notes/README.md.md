# Game Dev Story

![boids debug view][boids debug view]

The first idea for a game concept was a system of floating entities.  
Entities was following a bigger entity with a concept, a moral symbol or a social subject.  
I've remembered about a class by **Alain Lioret** about the IA behavior called boids or flocking,  
and I really wanted to develop further this algorithm : [boids pseudocode]

Later, the [Ludum Dare] #33 was starting soon, the [warmup weekend] was open.  
I decided to code early on the boids engine, so I could have time to make more illustrations  
I finally made a boids prototype that could display a message and had collisions  
([boids prototype]) ([demo video]) ([prototype source])

Then ! The game jam start and I'm starting to have a new idea :  
Like in horizontal scroller, you control the character's thoughts,  
and have to avoid rectangular signs. The game would take place in a subway for example,  
and the signs would be oppressive ads like the movie *They Live*.  
You would had to collect letter on the road to discover a message a the end of the level.

But I was in vacation at the country-side,  
and I already work all the week at the office, coding iPhone apps and Oculus 360 players.  ([where I work])  
So after failing at rewriting a rectangular collision system (something already done in the past!)  
I focused on the actual game mechanic and was inspired by [Osmos]  
Big bubbles can absorb little ones. Absorbing make the bubble grow and split when too large.

I've quickly saw that the rhythm and the speed of the boids did not fit with a relaxed puzzle game.  
And there was no real balance of anything so the bubbles was multiplying themselves indefinitely.  
So no more growing and shrinking, just absorption and resorption.

The theme of Ludum Dare #33 was You are the monster,  
so I've tried something with sad and depressing thoughts.  
I've tried an aesthetic of black and white with inspirations like  
Id√©es Noires of Franquin or the stories of Robert Crumb and Gotlib.

But then the time runs out like wooow! And the 72h of game jam was over.  
So I accepted to not finish it, because the real thing was the Oujevipo Contest #2.
