## The beginning

The first idea for a game concept was a system of floating entities.  
Entities was following a bigger entity with a concept, a moral symbol or a social subject.  
I've remembered a class by **Alain Lioret** about the IA behavior called boids or flocking,  
and I really wanted to develop further this algorithm : [boids pseudocode]

## Ludum Dare Warmup Weekend

![Ludum Dare logo][Ludum Dare logo]

Later, the [Ludum Dare] #33 was starting soon, the [warmup weekend] was open.  
I decided to code early on the boids engine, so I could have time to make more illustrations  
I finally made a boids prototype that could display a message and had collisions  
([boids prototype]) ([demo video]) ([prototype source])

A debug view to see what is happening behind the bubbles :

## Ludum Dare #33

Then ! The game jam start and I'm starting to have a new idea :  
Like in horizontal scroller, you control the character's thoughts, and have to avoid rectangular signs.  
The game would take place in a subway for example, and the signs would be oppressive ads like the movie *They Live*.  
You would had to collect letter on the road to discover a message a the end of the level.

![Another idea][Another idea]

After failing at rewriting a rectangular collision system (something already done in the past!)  
I focused on the actual game mechanic and was inspired by [Osmos]  
Big bubbles can absorb little ones. Absorbing make the bubble grow and split when too large.  

![gifs prototype divisions][gifs prototype divisions]

I've quickly saw that the rhythm and the speed of the boids did not fit.  
And there was no real balance of anything so the bubbles was multiplying themselves indefinitely.  
So no more growing and shrinking, just absorption and resorption.  

Bubble Leaking :

The theme of [Ludum Dare] #33 was **You are the monster**,  
so I've tried something with sad and depressing thoughts.  

![Crumb][Crumb]

I've tried an aesthetic of black and white with inspirations like  
Id√©es Noires of **Franquin** or the drawings of **Robert Crumb**.  

![Franquin][Franquin]

But I was in vacation at the country-side, then the time runs out like wooow!  
And the 72 hours of game jam was over. ([my submission for Ludum Dare #33])  
So I accepted to not finish it, because the real thing was the [Oujevipo Contest #2].  

## Ludum Dare Post Jam

The jam version, the project sent before the dead-line was far away from being finished.  
I've reboot the project and optimize performance.  
It was time to do research and development again !  
Tweaking boids rules and balance of power to get a satisfying behavior.

Add some colors :

I've even made a menu :  
![PostJam menu gif][PostJam menu gif]

But hey ! It's time to actually do a **game** !  
With a goal, levels, scores, sounds, musics and all the rest.

## Oujevipo Contest #2
### From a toy to a game

So this great boids engine has to find some purpose !  
Since you can absorb and resorb thoughts, may be the game could be a puzzle where you have to manage thoughts of people ?

A character would appear and would think about ideas, those ideas have a certain color.  
When you absorb all the thoughts, you reveal the personality of the character,  
and you know what the character wants.  
So I've started a game logic base on distribution,  
It is about **learning** (absorption), **sharing** (giving) and **loving** (distribute what one wants)  

![Choupichoup gif 1][Choupichoup gif 1]

Also, when you try to absorb bigger thoughts than you, it won't work.  
But if your avatar got thoughts that follow him,
they will give the avatar more size to absorb bigger than him.  
It is about **the power of knowledge**, of **culture**.  

It was actually fun, challenging and the message of learning, sharing and loving was deeply connected to the game mechanics.

But the mechanic of giving and the balance of power was too subtle to explain without text (because of a chosen constraint) and making excellent level design, that makes you learn basics and shows progressions and variations is really hard and was too much work for the time left.



After seeing people playing the game withouth notices and failing at understanding what to do, I've decided to let it as a toy !  

Because the public is a child of 6 to 13 years old.
